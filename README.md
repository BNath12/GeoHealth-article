### Predicting the Distribution of Arsenic in Groundwater by a Geospatial Machine Learning Technique in the Two Most Affected Districts of Assam, India: The Public Health Implications

The resources contain grid averaged arsenic concentration (mean concentrations) and predictor variables in Jorhat and Golaghat districts of Assam. GPS location has included error terms for privacy. Basic workflow random forest model in python environment is also provided. Final model was determined through random 10-fold cross-validation. Final model was used in the prediction of arsenic probability in unknown locations. We have also checked spatial cross-validation. The results were found to be consistent and confirmed the overall distribution of high/moderate/low-risk zones for arsenic in groundwater.
